    "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death around the world. If we are able to predict whether an individual will have cardiovascular disease, it can save numerous lives. This dataset consists of 11 factors that potentially predicts heart failure: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise induced angina, old peak, and the slope of peak exercise. Using statistics and machine learning, this project aims to determine if these factors can predict whether an individual will have cardiovascular disease."

Hence, this plot explores if cardiovascular disease was exercise-based for this dataset and also separates for gender to see if there is any relevance. The Altair plot shows a combined chart to compare between presence of ExerciseAngina and the distribution of the heart rate values for each age for males vs. females. Interactively, the slider controls for the specific age and we can see the differences in the scatter plot for each gender, with the points being color-coded orange for the presence of heart disease and blue for the absence. The visualization reveals that in all age groups, exercise angina did associate with heart disease prevalence across heart rates. Yet, where there was no exercise induced angina, there was still prevalence of heart disease. Exercised induced angina patients also did not show a correlation with max heart rates across most ages, indicating that the angina presence did not have an effect on heart rate variable. The trend of higher heart disease in older ages regardless was also seen as well."
